Hi there!
This is a full stack project, here is the backend repo (built with Spring Boot): https://github.com/Gatchan1/Virtual_Pet-Backend

### Deploy: https://virtual-pet-frontend-eight.vercel.app/
(The backend is deployed at Heroku)

This frontend app is built with **ReactJS**, written in JavaScript with vanilla CSS (plus a little bit of Bootstrap). 
It was started with **Vite** and uses **Axios** for the API requests.\
I made a couple of custom hooks... and it has a fully responsive design.

What is this app about: The user would create a user account, and once logged in they can create their own **virtual pets**, 
which they'll have to take care of through feeding and playing with them, and also one can change the pet's accessories and/or 
switch to a different location.

When a pet is created, it comes with a "unique" personality: random preferences regarding accessories and locations.
Also their level of happiness and energy decreases automatically as time passes by, but when sleeping they regain energy.

This was one of the two final projects made for my Java & Spring Framework bootcamp (@It Academy, Barcelona, 2024).  \
I had a lot of fun building it! âœ¨
