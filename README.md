Hi there!
This is a full stack project, here is the backend repo (built with Spring Boot): https://github.com/Gatchan1/Virtual_Pet-Backend

This frontend app is written in JavaScript with vanilla CSS (plus a little bit of Bootstrap). It was started with Vite and uses axios for the API requests.
I used a couple of custom hooks... and it has a fully responsive design.

When a pet is created, it comes with a "unique" personality: random preferences regarding accessories and locations.
Also their level of happiness and energy decreases automatically as time passes by, but when sleeping they regain energy.

This was one of the two final projects made for my Java & Spring Framework bootcamp (@It Academy, Barcelona, 2024).  \
I had a lot of fun building it! âœ¨
